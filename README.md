# pbuild
A personal build script by Pigeon Nation that can run on a macbook m1 or later (I think).
Compiles c/c++ to windows x86, macos aarch/x86, linux x86

To build everything in a src directory located in the same folder as this script:
`python3 build.py build`

To clean everything up before a git commit:
`python3 build.py clean`
